# Project MazeBot
Task:
- Make the robot reach the finish line by solving the maze, return to start using the shortest Path

What can your robot do?
- My robot can navigate to the target cell with 100% accuracy
- While going to the target cell, it can sense and draw the walls on the remote screen automatically
- After reaching the target cell, it can reach back to the original map using the shortest path

What canâ€™t your robot do?
- My robot cannot move continuously (The robot needs to stop on each square)
- The robot cannot go to a specific distance or turn to a specific degree very accurately
- I used the method of "hitting walls" to solve the problem
